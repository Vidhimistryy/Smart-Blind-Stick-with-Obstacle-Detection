# Overview
An Arduino-based assistive device that helps visually impaired individuals detect obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. The device provides real-time haptic feedback through a buzzer or vibration motor when an object is detected within a specified range.

# Features

- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors
- Buzzer alert for proximity warnings
- Easy to build and deploy
- Low-cost and effective

# Logic Summary

- Measure distance using ultrasonic sensor
- If distance is less than threshold (e.g., 50 cm), activate buzzer
- Else, buzzer remains off

---

# How to Run

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Open `smart_blind_stick.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select the correct board and port
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board
5. Connect your components as per the circuit diagram

# Output

Distance: 47 cm â†’ Buzzer ON
Distance: 122 cm â†’ Buzzer OFF
Distance: 18 cm â†’ Buzzer ON

> ðŸ”‰ A buzzing sound/vibration occurs when obstacle is close
